"""The plan-then-apply CLIs must not open a second transaction.

`sync_shopify_masters --apply` failed on its first production run with
`InvalidRequestError: A transaction is already begun on this Session`. The
planning step reads through the session, SQLAlchemy autobegins a transaction for
those reads, and the `async with session.begin()` that followed tried to open a
second one.

The unit tests did not catch it because their fake sessions answered `execute()`
without modelling that a read starts a transaction. So the fake here does model
it, and the same shape was already present — unexercised — in
`audit_shopify_stock`, whose only tested path was `--dry-run`.
