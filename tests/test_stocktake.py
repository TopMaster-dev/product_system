"""実地棚卸 (P2-028) — counting in instalments without emptying the shelf.

The client confirmed on 2026-09-22 that they will count by category: RING is
265 SKUs, KEYRING is 3, and a single day covers one of them. So every upload is
a PARTIAL count, and the defining property of this module is what it does with
the SKUs that are not on the sheet.

It does nothing with them. An absent row is not a count of zero, and neither is
a blank cell. Reading either as zero would, on the first RING day, propose
emptying every necklace, bracelet, pierce, anklet and key ring in the
catalogue — and each proposal would arrive in the approval queue looking like a
routine correction, because a queue of proposed corrections is exactly what it
is.

That is the same rule the Shopify audit calls "absent is not zero". It is worth
restating in its own tests because here the absent rows are the majority.
