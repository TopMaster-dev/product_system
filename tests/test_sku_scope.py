"""Unit tests for the single SKU-population predicate, plus a guard that forbids
re-deriving it anywhere else.

The guard matters more than it looks: four independently-written Phase 2 designs
each named this predicate differently, and one said "if it does not exist when
this area starts, this area creates it". Two copies with slightly different
exclusion semantics is precisely how a bundle parent shows up in one screen and
not the next.
