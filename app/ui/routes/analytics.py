"""分析ダッシュボード — 概要 (P2-009 / P2-011 / P2-012).

Everything on this page is read from `daily_kpi_snapshots` and friends, never
computed live from events. That is what makes a 365-day window answerable, and
it is also why the provenance banner exists: a materialised number is only as
current as the job that wrote it, and a stale dashboard looks exactly like a
fresh one.

Three states get their own band at the top rather than a footnote:

* **snapshot drift** — a stock figure here disagrees with the event log it
  derives from. Red, because nothing else on the page can be relied on until it
  is resolved.
* **stale rollup** — the numbers are real but old.
* **materially unmapped revenue** — above 5% of the total, the channel shares
  stop describing the business, and the fix is Rakuten SKU maintenance rather
  than anything on this screen.

The period ends YESTERDAY, never today. A partial day in a trend line reads as
a collapse in sales every single morning.
