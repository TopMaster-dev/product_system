"""MappingService — resolve channel SKUs and replay pending orders.

When an order arrives whose `channel_sku` has no active mapping, ingestion
leaves the order in `pending_mapping` state and records a `MappingAlert`.
Once the operator resolves the alert by creating a `ChannelSkuMapping`, this
service backfills `master_sku_id` on the parked order items and applies them to
stock — preserving idempotency end-to-end.

Two rules make the replay match first ingestion, which it did not before:

* It applies each line through `InventoryService.consume_order_line`, so a
  共有在庫 parent reaches its pool and a 在庫管理対象外 master writes nothing.
* It confirms an order only when nothing of it is unmapped. One alert is one
  channel SKU, and an order can be waiting on several.
