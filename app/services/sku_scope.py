"""The single source of truth for "which master SKUs does this query cover?".

Every screen, job and aggregate in Phase 2 narrows the SKU population, and each
one narrows it *differently*. Writing those predicates inline is how ~32 bundle
parents and ~400 archived masters end up included in one screen and excluded from
the next — a discrepancy nobody notices until the numbers are compared.

Three flags participate, and they mean genuinely different things:

`is_bundle`
    Set/shared-stock parents. They hold NO stock of their own; availability is
    derived from `bundle_components`. Counting them in a stock or demand
    aggregate double-counts their components.

`is_stock_managed`
    False for gift boxes, coupons, made-to-order items. These "sell" with every
    order but have no physical stock, so they march negative forever (one hit
    -12509 in Phase 1-B) and they polluted the best-seller ranking. They produce
    no inventory events at all once flagged.

`archived_at`
    Retired masters — mostly the legacy product-level rows the variant cutover
    replaced. This is a VISIBILITY concept, not an inventory one, which is why it
    is handled asymmetrically:

        current-state screens/jobs  ->  exclude archived
        historical period aggregates ->  INCLUDE archived

    Filtering archived out of a period report would erase those masters' past
    sales and silently break every comparison spanning the 2026-07-20 cutover.

Because that asymmetry is the easiest thing to get wrong, `include_archived` is a
REQUIRED keyword on `analysable_conditions()`: callers must state whether they are
reporting on history or on the present.

Usage:

    stmt = select(MasterSku).where(*analysable_conditions(include_archived=True))
